## 1. Concept & Requirement Analysis

- **Define Project Scope:**

  - **Core Functionality:** Automatically generate subtitles from video content using AI, then allow users to select from various subtitle styles (e.g., bold with popping effects, clean, classic Hormozi, comic, banger effect, karaoke-style word-by-word).
  - **Subtitle Customization:** Options to choose fonts (Montserrat, Roboto, Arial, Comic Sans) and tweak styling via a UI (initial video prompt and Magic Edit box).
  - **Multilingual Support:** Initially support English and Hindi subtitles.
  - **User Management:** Registration, login, password recovery via a 6-digit code emailed to the user; include Google and Facebook authentication.
  - **Platform Use Cases:** Social media content, marketing, educational videos, and blog content.

- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - Focus on a beautiful, responsive UI/UX (ReactJS frontend).
  - High performance in subtitle generation and editing.
  - Security for user data and authentication.

## 2. System Architecture & Technology Stack

- **Frontend:**

  - **Framework:** ReactJS
  - **Design:** Emphasis on attractive colors, fonts, buttons, and layout; consider component libraries for faster prototyping.
  - **Features:** FAQ section, video preview with real-time subtitle style changes.

- **Backend:**

  - **Framework:** Django (RESTful API development)
  - **Components:**
    - User authentication & management (including social logins).
    - Video processing (storage, audio extraction).
    - Integration with AI for speech-to-text conversion.
    - Subtitle management (generation, editing, exporting).

- **Database & Storage:**

  - **Database:** PostgreSQL/MySQL for user data and metadata.
  - **File Storage:** Cloud-based storage (e.g., AWS S3) for video and subtitle files.

- **Third-Party Services:**
  - AI Speech-to-Text API for auto subtitle generation.
  - Email service for sending 6-digit authentication codes.
  - OAuth integrations for Google and Facebook.

---

## 3. UI/UX Design & Prototyping

- **Wireframing & Mockups:**

  - Design screens for the landing page, authentication flows (login, signup, forgot password), video upload, subtitle styling dashboard, and FAQ.
  - Prototype user interactions like subtitle style selection and live preview.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Ensure the application looks and works well on various devices and screen sizes.
  - Use design systems and consistent style guides.

---

## 4. Backend Development Planning

- **Project Structure:**
  - Set up a Django project with separate apps for authentication, video processing, and subtitle management.
- **Database Models:**

  - **User:** Extend the user model to include additional fields as needed.
  - **Video:** Model for storing video metadata and file paths.
  - **Subtitle:** Model to save auto-generated and edited subtitles, including styling options.
  - **Authentication Tokens:** Manage email verification codes and OAuth tokens.

- **API Endpoints:**

  - RESTful endpoints for user authentication, video upload, subtitle generation, style selection, and subtitle export.
  - Secure endpoints with proper authorization checks.

- **Third-Party Integrations:**
  - Implement API calls for AI-based transcription.
  - Integrate email sending functionality for 6-digit codes.
  - Set up OAuth integration for Google and Facebook logins.

## 5. Frontend Development Planning

- **Component Breakdown:**

  - **Authentication Components:** Login, signup, and forgot password forms with email verification.
  - **Video Upload & Preview:** Interface to upload videos and display subtitles in real time.
  - **Subtitle Styling Dashboard:** Controls for choosing subtitle styles, fonts, and additional effects.
  - **FAQ & Help Sections:** Informative sections to guide users.

- **API Integration:**

  - Consume the Django API endpoints using fetch/axios.
  - Handle asynchronous operations (e.g., video processing, subtitle generation).

- **UI/UX Enhancements:**
  - Ensure components use the selected fonts and styling.
  - Implement responsive design patterns and interactive UI elements.

## 6. AI-Driven Auto Subtitle Generation Flow

- **Video Upload & Processing:**

  - User uploads a video via the ReactJS interface.
  - Video is stored on the server or cloud storage.

- **Audio Extraction & Transcription:**

  - Extract audio from the video.
  - Send the audio data to an AI-based speech-to-text service.
  - Receive a transcript that may include timestamps for subtitle segments.

- **Subtitle Formatting:**

  - Process the transcript to generate segmented subtitles.
  - Apply user-selected styles and fonts.
  - Implement different display effects (e.g., karaoke style highlighting each word).

- **Multilanguage Support:**
  - Configure the AI service to handle both English and Hindi.
  - Provide options for switching between languages as required.

---

## 7. Authentication & Authorization Flow

- **Standard Authentication:**

  - Implement signup/login using Django’s authentication framework.
  - Integrate password reset via a 6-digit code sent to the user’s email.

- **Social Authentication:**

  - Set up OAuth flows for Google and Facebook authentication.
  - Ensure proper token management and user session security.

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Use HTTPS, secure storage for passwords, and proper session management.
  - Validate all incoming data on both frontend and backend.

---

## 8. Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Unit Testing:**

  - Write tests for individual components and API endpoints.
  - Test video upload, audio extraction, and AI transcription integration.

- **Integration Testing:**

  - Validate end-to-end flows from video upload to subtitle export.
  - Test authentication flows including social logins and OTP verification.

- **UI/UX Testing:**

  - Perform cross-browser and responsive testing.
  - Conduct user testing to refine the interface and experience.

- **Performance Testing:**
  - Evaluate the speed of subtitle generation.
  - Stress-test the system for high-load scenarios.

---

## 9. Deployment Strategy

- **Environment Setup:**

  - Prepare staging and production environments.
  - Use containerization (Docker) for consistent deployment.

- **CI/CD Pipeline:**

  - Automate testing and deployment processes.
  - Use cloud services (AWS, GCP, or similar) for hosting the backend and static assets.

- **Configuration:**

  - Set up environment variables for API keys and database credentials.
  - Configure static file serving for the ReactJS frontend.

- **Post-Deployment:**
  - Monitor system performance and user activity.
  - Implement logging and error tracking.
